- Where to play my game: https://pallavirajeev.github.io/PhysicsGame/ 
- How Experience Requirements are Met:
    - The game uses the up, left, and right arrow keys to move the cat (player) in order to jump over 
        the platforms. When the player collides with the star they move onto the summary screen of that level.
    - The player's goal of colliding with the star can only be done indirectly with the help of 
        Phaser physics arcade. There is no other way of moving to the next level, unless the player is moved with the arrow keys to move over the platform(s) and collide with the star.
    - There are three levels to the game, each with a more complicated task (an extra platform to jump
        over). 
    - These levels are each separated with a summary scene indicating you completed the level.
- How Assets were Created:
    - All art/assets was created by myself, hand-drawn on pixilart.com and Procreate
